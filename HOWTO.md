# ἀλήθεια

The objective of the game is to unconceal the 'truth' - inside a 'truth table'.

The header of each square box provides a clue that can be decoded into bricks filling none, some or all of the 4 cells within the box.

The presence or absence of a brick within a cell is fully determined by the values of A and B as inferred from the clue provided by the square box header, as illustrated below:

The aim of the game is to unconceal all the true values ​​by clicking only on the cells containing a colored brick.

Making mistakes doesn't hurt, but striving for accuracy enhances the overall enjoyment of the game, particularly with the textual and auditory rewards when finished.
