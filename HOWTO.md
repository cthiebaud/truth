The objective of the game is to unconceal the 'truth' - inside a ['truth table'](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truth_table).

The header of each square box provides a clue that can be decoded into bricks filling none, some or all of the 4 cells within the box.

The presence or absence of a brick within a cell is fully determined by the values of A and B as inferred from the clue, expressed in [logic symbols](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_logic_symbols) (𝖠 ∧ 𝖡)</strong>, or JavaScript (α & β), as illustrated below:

The aim of the game is to unconceal all the true values ​​by clicking only on the cells containing a colored brick.

Making mistakes doesn't hurt, but striving for accuracy enhances the overall enjoyment of the game, particularly with the textual and auditory rewards when finished.
