The objective of the game is to uncovers the 'truth' - inside a 'truth table'

Each square box header contains a clue - which decodes into bricks that fill some or all of the 4 cells within the box.

The presence or absence of a brick within a cell depends on the values of A and B - as inferred from the clue displayed in the square box header, as shown in the example below:

The objective of the game is to uncover all the truth values by clicking only on those cells which contain a colored brick. 

There is no harm in making errors, but aiming for accuracy enhances the game's overall satisfaction, in particular the textual and auditive rewards at game completion.
